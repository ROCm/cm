llvm-lit

Usage: cm lit [OPTIONS] [TESTS]... [-- <ARGS>...]

Arguments:
  [TESTS]...
          Lit test paths to run

  [ARGS]...
          Trailing arguments to forward to llvm-lit
          
          Note that the -- separator is mandatory to signal the beginning of these verbatim
          arguments, which is inconsistent with other subcommands like configure and build. This is
          a compromise to make explicit passing of tests more ergonomic such that the default case
          requires no additional flags or separators.

Options:
  -p, --print-only
          Print tests that would be run

  -x, --xfail-export
          Print a command-line which exports LIT_XFAIL to the tests that would be run

  -c, --config <CONFIG>
          Build Config
          
          [default: Release]

  -u, --update-resultdb[=<BOOL>]
          Update the ResultDB file.
          
          Defaults to true unless -1/--first or a list of tests (via positional arguments) are
          specified.
          
          Accepts explicit argument via -u/--update-resultdb=true or -u/--update-resultdb=false and
          has a shorthand -u/--update-resultdb for the former.
          
          [default: true]
          [possible values: true, false]

  -d, --debug
          Shorthand for `--config Debug`

  -g, --group <GROUP>
          Run the named LLVM "check-*" test group, and (by default) update the ResultDB.
          
          For known groups ("possible values") the name can be shortened by omitting the "check-"
          prefix, and only needs to specify enough characters to unambiguously identify the test
          group. For example simply "a" is enough to identify "check-all".
          
          [possible values: all, llvm, clang, lld]

  -#, --dry-run
          Perform a dry run, only printing the generated command line

  -1, --first
          Only consider at most the first failing test in the ResultDB

  -q, --quirks <QUIRKS>
          Disable quirk mode detection and specify one explicitly
          
          [possible values: none, llvm]

  -v, --verbose
          Be as verbose as possible, asking FileCheck to dump its input and asking llvm-lit to
          forward it to stdout

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

CMAKE DIRECTORY OPTIONS:
  -s, --source <SOURCE>
          CMake Source Directory

  -b, --binary <BINARY>
          CMake Binary Directory
