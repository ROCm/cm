Print shell commands to activate a set of global options

The "activate" command sets variables for the source directory ("CM_SRC"), binary directory
("CM_BIN"), configuration ("CM_CFG"), and quirks mode ("CM_QUIRKS"), which are interpreted as-if
they were provided on the command-line. To simplify executing binaries in the binary directory it
also prepends the "bin" subdirectory in the binary path to the "PATH" environment variable.
